# DeadMatterServerManager
Server manager for Dead Matter

## First run steps

<b>If you plan to install via SteamCMD</b>
* Set your SteamCMD path (if you don't have it, choose a folder to install to)
* Update SteamCMD
* Set your Server Folder path (if you don't have it, choose a folder to install to)
* Enter your Steam ID and Password (these are used for getting the server files via SteamCMD and are not stored anywhere)
* Update Server

<b>If you plan to install via Steam Client (note, currently this seems to cause less issues when running the server)</b>
* Locate 'Dead Matter Dedicated Server' in your Steam library under Tools
* Install and run once from your library.  Once the server has fully loaded, close it down
* Open up the Server Manager and point the Server Folder path to your install location

## Configuration
* If you already have a server configuration click *Get Config* to populate the settings table with your current settings
* Modify the settings as required
* Add admins/whitelist players via the *Admin/Whitelist* tab
* Save Config to write your changes to the server configuration files
* Enter your maximum memory for the server, when the server reaches this value it will restart.  If you do not set a value the server will just run until it crashes and will automatically restart
* If you wish to restart the server on a timer, set the number of minutes you want your server to run for before restarting

## Start Server
* Starting the server will launch a new window with the server output.
* If the server crashes for any reason the application will automatically start it again.
* If you want to stop the server, click *Stop Server*
